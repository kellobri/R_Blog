Over the next several months I'll be teaming up with the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) blog to release a series of cool `#rstats` community interviews. Check out the first one which went live today! [.rprofile: David Smith](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/10/13/rprofile-david-smith)

I proposed this interview series as a side-project for rOpenSci unconf17 which took place in Los Angeles last May. The original idea was to put together a loosely defined set of interview questions for the purpose of “Demystifying the Creative/Development Process of the R Community”. All of the interviews we conducted ended up different, both from each other and from the pre-defined statement of purpose, but I’m incredibly happy with the final products and grateful for the opportunity I had to chat with these folks about their work and life.
