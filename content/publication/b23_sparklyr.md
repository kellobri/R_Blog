abstract = "Since it’s official release announcement in the fall of 2016, there has been a great deal of interest in Sparklyr and its potential uses in the R community. Most of the Getting Started tutorials we’ve seen come out so far however, have been variations or direct reproductions of R Studio’s own release documentation. R is not a distributed application, while Spark was designed to scale across many hosts easily and efficiently. In a nutshell, Sparklyr allows users to take advantage of R’s familiar syntax, while using Spark for scalable distributed data processing. So why are there no use cases to highlight these mutually compatible strengths?"
